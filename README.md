The lab will take place in RR15.

# Grading

Grading will be done through weekly exercise sheets.
At the beginning of each lab you are asked to mark which exercises you have solved by yourself *and* prepared for presentation.
Marking an exercises therefore not only means that you have a solution, but also that you are able to explain it to the class and answer questions related to the exercise and its context.
To pass this PS you have to:

- mark at least 65% of all exercises (excluding bonus exercises); and
- receive at least one positive grade for a presentation.

Note that exercises can build on-top of each other -- even across exercise sheets.
Solutions will *not* be provided.
Organise yourself with your fellow students if you are missing crucial material.

Each of the folders `ex01`, `ex02`, ... represents on exercise sheet.
Exercise tasks and material are located within these folders.

You do not have to submit your solution unless stated explicitly by the exercise.

## Presentation

How exactly you present your solution is up to you.
Just be prepared to fit your explanation in a 20 minute slot.
While a computer is provided by the ZID you are advised to bring your own laptop along.
Please check if your system is compatible with the installed projector before the lab starts.
VGA is the only way to connect your laptop with the projector.

> In ZID we do not trust.

## Note about C++17

Most compilers already implement C++ 17 features, you are free to use them, but remember that they are still considered experimental.
Use `-std=c++1z` to access these features.
