### Game Mechanic: Status Effects

Status effects modificate the status of a player. Examples include:
- Poisoning
- Confusion
- On fire
- etc.

## Definition of the Status Effects

We define a class to hold information about a status effect and to actually 
perform the modifications on the player.

    |---------------------------|
    |StatusEffect               |
    |---------------------------|
    | -duration : double        |
    | +update(player : Player)  |
    | +isExpired() : bool       |
    |---------------------------|

The StatusEffect is an abstract base for individual status effects. 

The individual status effects must implement the update method, which 
modifies the player and reduces the duration. If the duration is less 
than or equal to zero, the status effect is expired and no action is
performed when the update method is called. In this case, the isExpired method
returns true.

The player contains a list of status effects whose update methods are called
for every step the player takes, i.e. status effects are tied to walking. There
will be no effect on the player while it is just sitting still.

Expired status effects are removed at this point. In addition, it should be 
possible to add status effects to the player, i.e. there has to be a public
method for this in the Player class.
