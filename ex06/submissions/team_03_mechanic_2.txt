Task 04:

Our next chosen game mechanic: healthbar, use of items (bomb, arrow)

The item (bomb or arrow) must be active in the inventory (indicated by the icon
in the upper left corner) before it can be activated with the "f" key.
An item should be created on the position of the player and act
as expected:
In the case of an arrow, it should fly in the right direction (where the player
is looking at), apply damage on hit and disappear after colliding.
In the case of a bomb, the item should explode after a few seconds and apply
damage to the surrounding entities.

In order to let the items disappear after a certain amount of time, you need to
take a timestamp when the item is used and check if it has passed your given
time. If that is the case you need to take the item out of the render pipeline
and delete it.

The health is visible in form of hearts and is implemented as a hud element in
the upper left corner. It should also update automatically if the hp of the
player changes (f.e.: if he takes dmg).
