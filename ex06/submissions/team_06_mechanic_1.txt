# Task 3 - Mechanic 1

### Basic Monsters with AI
- Various monster types which act differently.
- Movement based on monster's goals (e.g. fight, survive, ...).
- Monsters move each time the player moves.

#### Implementation
- Monsters are a subclass of MovingEntity.
- Method MovingEntity::move() does out of bounds/collision checks.
- All subclasses of MovingEntity should use MovingEntity::move().
- Implement different movement algorithms corresponding to goal in subclasses.
- Make actual monsters subclasses of subclasses based on monster's goal.

##### Randomly Moving Monster (RMM)
- Moves in x or y direction based on coinflip.
- Moves along the chosen axis based on coinflip.
- May just stay in place.

##### Fixed Moving Pattern Monster (FMPM)
- Moves along a fixed path.

##### Chasing Monster
- Subclass of RMM or FMPM.
- When player gets close, starts to chase player.
- Gets exhausted (stays) after set amount of turns.
- Start chasing again if player gets close.

##### Frightened Monster
- Subclass of RMM or FMPM.
- When player gets close, starts to flee from player.
- Has to be cornered to kill.
