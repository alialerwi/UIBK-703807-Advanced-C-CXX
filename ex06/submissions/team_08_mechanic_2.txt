# Inventory System

## Overview

This is assuming collision detection is already implemented.

Each player can gather other entities. For simplicity this specification
assumes that a player's inventory can hold eiter one or no entity. If a
player's inventory already contains an entity if a new one is added, the old
entity simply gets deleted from the repository.

Assuming each entity has a name, a players inventory can be displayed by
displaying the name of the entity in the inventory.

There are entities that can be picked up and ones that cannot be picked up.

An entity that can be picked up is picked up by colliding into it.

If an entity gets picked up by a player, it gets removed from the game field.

If an entity gets removed from a player's inventory, it gets placed back to
the game field at the current position of the player.

An entity gets removed dfrom the player's inventory by pressing a certain key.

## API

Each entity must provide an interface to perform the following actions:

- Getting an entites name
- Removing the entity from the game field (when picking it up)
- Setting the position of the entity when placing it back on the game field.

Each player must provide an interfact to perform the following actions:

- Adding an entity to the player's inventory
- Getting the name of the entity in the player's inventory
- Removing an entity from the player's inventory

The game must be able to display the name of the entity in the players
inventory on the press of a certain key. 

## Implementation

The following is an outline on how to implement such conditions:

- Add a `canBePickedUp` flag to each entity.
- Add a `name` member to each entity that can be picked up.
- Add an optional `inventory` member to the `Player` class.
- On collision with an entity that can be picked up, remove the entity from
  the game's entities and set the player's inventory to be this entity.
- When pressing the key to show the players inventory, render the name of
  the inventory's entity.
- When pressing the key to remove the inventory entity, set the position
  of the entity to equal the player's position and place it back in the
  game's entities list before the player (so that it gets rendered below it).
