# Task 1 - Changes

### Constants

#### Current State
- Constants are defined in various files (usually where there are used).

#### Problems
- Constants may be used in other files which results in moving them alot.

#### Wanted Change
- Create a file which contains all constants and can be included.


### Entity Hierarchy

#### Current State
- Base class Entity has attributes game, position and sprite set.
- Base class Entity has methods for moving and updating the entity.
- Player is subclass of entity and overrides update method.

#### Problems
- Not all entities need a move method (e.g. walls).
- Most entities need a rectangle for collision check (e.g. walls, player).

#### Wanted Change
- Specify a base class which has only position and sprite set (e.g. floor).
- Create Hierarchy starting with said base class.

#### Hierarchy

| Class        | pos | sprite_set | collides() | move() | Example |
|:-------------|:---:|:----------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------|
| Entity       |  x  |     x      |            |        | Floor   |
| Colliding    |  x  |     x      |     x      |        | Wall    |
| Moving       |  x  |     x      |     x      |   x    | Enemy   |
| Controllable |  x  |     x      |     x      |   x    | Player  |

*Note: this hierarchy may later be extended (e.g. for characters/enemies).*
