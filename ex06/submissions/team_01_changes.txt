This file contains the changes done by us (Team 01).

The first change that we implemented was the ability to load an initial map.
The map is structured like a matrix, is located in the /resources/maps folder
and a typical map can look like the following:

***************
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*     p       *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
*             *
***************

The symbols in the matrix all define different game objects that will be placed
in the game after the map is loaded and represent the following:
'*' is a wall.
' ' is floor (walkable).
'p' is the start point of the player character.

To be able to represent the objects in the game world we created new entities
named floor and wall in the application. They are initialized with different
sprites that match their purposes.

We also changed the SPRITE_WIDTH and SPRITE_HEIGTH to 16 to match our object
sprites and the new player character sprites that we introduced.

To implement collision detection we changed the entity class to contain
information about the type of game object it is in the world. Before a move of
the player character is done, we check if the future position is invalid
according to the type of the object the player would move on to. Based on this,
we enable or disable movement in this direction.

We also introduced a camera that follows the player character along his
adventure. By simply applying the formula 'SCREEN = WORLD - CAMERA' we render
the entities according to their position on the screen created by the offset of
our camera. Furthermore for every movement the player does, the camera
coordinates are calculated accordingly.
