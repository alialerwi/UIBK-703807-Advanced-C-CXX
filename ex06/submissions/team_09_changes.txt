### Changes made based on the provided application ###

+ We extended the vector class in order to support a bit more operations, which
  could be useful for later steps in development.

+ We added the SL2_ttf library for rendering text and Boost for loading and
  parsing the dungeon-map-files.

+ In the resources folder we added the subdirectories map and fonts for saving
  levels and font styles. Font styles are also used for text-rendering.

In general we didn't really change the initial code base very much. All the
other changes were done during development of the other tasks.
