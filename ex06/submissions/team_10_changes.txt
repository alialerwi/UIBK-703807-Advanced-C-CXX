The following changes where made to the codebase:

- replaced log macros with sdl logging
- removed game reference from entity (game is only passed as parameter to the
  update function)
- made resource loader singleton to remove the game dependency from entities
  (see change above)
- refactored everything except moving from entity into new class renderable
- renamed entity to movable
- moved sprite coordinates from spriteset to renderable (allowing to change
  the sprite position for single renderables if multiple renderables share
  the same spriteset)
- added + and == operator for Vec2
- added the player as member to the game class
