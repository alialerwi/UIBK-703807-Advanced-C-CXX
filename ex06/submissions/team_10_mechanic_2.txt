### Game Mechanic: Enemies

Enemies are entities roaming the map and damaging the player on contact.

## Definition of Enemies

We define a class to hold information about an ememy, derived from Movable.

    |--------------------------------------|
    |Enemy                                 |
    |--------------------------------------|
    | -updateGap : int                     |
    | -strengh : int                       |
    | -lastUpdate : time_point             |
    | -walk(game : Game, direction : Vec2) |
    | -dealDamage(game : Game)             |
    | +update(game : Game)                 |
    |--------------------------------------|

updateGap defines how big the gap (in milliseconds) should be between moves 
of the enemy. strength defines how much damage touching the enemy deals. This
is expressed as the number of HPs the player loses upon contact.

lastUpdate saves when the last move was performed and is used to correctly 
time actions.

The walk method implements movement of the enemy. It is responsible to check 
for collisions with obstacles etc.

The dealDamage method checks for contact with the player and deals damage 
accordingly.

The update method from the base class Moveable has to be overridden. It is
responsible for correctly calling walk and dealDamage and to correctly time
those actions according to updateGap.

## Behavior of Enemies

For the current version of the game, enemies perform random movements, making
sure not to bump into obstacles. This is subject to change and could be
replaced by more sophisticated movement paths in a future version.

Also, for the current version, enemies disappear upon touching the player and
respawn at a random location. This is also subject to change.
