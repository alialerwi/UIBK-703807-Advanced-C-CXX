--[ 1 - Mechanic Enemies

----[ 1.1 - Description

This mechanic is about enemies. For example the enemies of
the player are bugs. Bugs are in the world walking randomly around,
hurting the player if they catch him. Enemies can also be
destroyed by the player in different ways. So for example
bugs can be destroyed by fixing them using a computer.

----[ 1.2 - Implementation

To implement this mechanic, an entity could be hurt.
So the function hurt is added to entity. It depends on the enemy,
how fast he dies (therefore the implementation is done in the
enemy class). The game class is responsible to spawn all enemies
in different rooms and keeps a list of all different types
(bugs, product owners etc.). So for example the computer can call
hurt on a bug using the bug list of the game, if the player interacts with the
computer. Two different functions are called by the game engine after a
player finished his round:

- "canAttack" returns true if the enemy is able to attack the player
- "attack" executes the attack on the player

Both functions could also be in one single function, but we decided to do it in
the player class with two functions because in this way we could for example
do attacks randomly if the player got a special item etc. This is for the
future and not for the current implementation. So with additional features
the current implementation must not be changed.
