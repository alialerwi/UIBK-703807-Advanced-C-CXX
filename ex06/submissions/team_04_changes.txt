--[ 1 - List of changes

- Added clion project and removed *.sln
- Renaming from roguelike to nerdshow (we implement a game where a developer
 must survive in a world full of bugs, bad product owners etc.)
- Moved header files to cc files -> clion default... so its easier to use the ide
- Renaming of cc files to cpp
- Updated images to nerd images (from freevector and flaticon)
- Changed SDL_RenderCopy to SDL_RenderCopyEx because of rotation
- We extended the function update, such that we can implement different behaviour when the
player finished his move (for example the player walked over a bug, so the bug attacks the player).
