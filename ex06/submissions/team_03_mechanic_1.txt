Task 03:

Our chosen game mechanic: inventory system

With the inventory system a player can store and take multiple items (for
example bombs or arrows) with him. Items should be separated classes which
are stored in a vector or a list (which represents the inventory). That list is
attached to the player object.

For convenience we decided that the player can keep as many items as he wants,
instead of limiting the inventory by size or by weight.
We also decided to show only the current equipped item from the inventory,
instead of visualizing an inventory menu. The player can simply switch between
items of his inventory through a button press.
