The game's monsters must act according to following rules:

    - monsters are stationary or move either straight horizontally or
      straight vertically

    - the direction of their movement inverts when they hit a wall or
      the player
        
        Example:

            ########
            #......#
            #<--M..#
            #......#
            #......#
            ########

            Monster M moves horizontally to the left, following the arrow,
            until it hits the wall, then:

            ########
            #......#
            #M---->#
            #......#
            #......#
            ########

            Monster M turns to the right and follows the arrow until
            it hits the right wall, turns left again etc.

    - monsters only have ranged attacks that work similar to the player's:

        * 3 consecutive blocks are affected

        * always deald deadly damage to the player and no damage to other
          monsters

        * only 1 projectile at a time per monster on the screen

        * projectiles are always fired as soon as the previous one disappears

        * there is a delay in projectile movement from block to block to make
          it slow enough to react to

        * projectiles are always fired orthogonally to the direction
          of movement
        
        Example:

            ########
            #......#
            #<--M..#
            #...x..#
            #...x..#
            ########

            Monster M moves along the arrow and fires projectiles in the
            direction marked by x

    - monsters have 4 health points which means that the player needs to
      deal 2 melee attacks or 4 ranged attacks to the same monster to kill it.
      This difference is meant to be a reward for taking the risk of getting
      close to the monster. The health points are NOT shown on screen
      (just like in the old Zelda games)

    - when a monster is hit by an attack, there should be visual cues confirming
      that it was hit (blinking in a different colour or something like that)

    - when monsters are killed, they are removed from the screen and
      will not respawn
