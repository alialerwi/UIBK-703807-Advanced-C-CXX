### COMBAT ###
##############

The combat mechanic needs to fulfill the following requirements:

    - the player has a melee attack mapped to one key and a ranged attack
      mapped to another key

    - melee attacks only affect the block in front of the player
      (so it depends on the direction the player is facing)

        Example:

            ########
            #......#
            #...P..#
            #...x..#
            #......#
            ########

            Player P faces down and x marks the block affected
            by his melee attack

    - ranged attacks fire a projectile in the direction the player is facing

    - the projectile will move straight for exactly 3 blocks, then disappear

        Example:

            ########
            #......#
            #.xxxP.#
            #......#
            #......#
            ########

            Player P faces left and the x's mark the 3 blocks affected
            by P's ranged attack.

            First there will be damage output at the rightmost x, then,
            after a fixed interval, the projectile moves ahead to the
            middle x and outputs damage and finally to the leftmost x,
            before it disappears.

    - there can only be one projectile on screen at a time, i.e. the player
      cannot fire another projectile before the previous one has travelled
      3 blocks or hit something

    - projectiles cannot go through walls and disappear if they hit a wall

    - if a projectile hits another projectile, both disappear

    - there is a delay in projectile movement from block to block to make it
      slow enough to react to (dodge)

    - projectiles also disappear if they hit a monster
     (in that case the monster takes damage)

    - melee attacks deal 2 damage points while projectiles deal only 1

    - if the player is hit by a monster projectile or runs into a monster
      (i.e. collision check with monster is positive) the player dies
      and it's game over
