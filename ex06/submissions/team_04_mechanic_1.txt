--[ 1 - Mechanic Item interaction

----[ 1.1 - Description

If the player walks to or over an item he can interact
with the item by pressing space. It depends on the item,
if the user can walk over the item or could only stand
before the item.
Also the interaction behaviour of the item depends on the item type.
For example a door opens if the player interact with it
or bugs are "fixed" if the player interacts with the computer.

----[ 1.2 - Implementation

To implement this game mechanic, the entity class could
provide two methods:

- "isInteractable" returns true, if the player could
interact with this entity (for example the player stands before a door)
- "interact" gets called, when the user wants to interact with this
entity.

The game class is responsible to check for all items in the world if they are
interactable (so call isInteractable on all items). If an item
is interactable the game class calls interact on this item.
Those calls should be executed, after a player finished his move.
