Changes:

We changed in the given implementation that the render function is given in
every object to receive cleaner code. So the entity class and the hud_element
class inherit the new Renderable class. Then in the game class for each element
the render function is called.
Since the WASD controls for moving are more used in computer games we changed
that.

Controls:
WASD: Moving
Q: Switch currently equipped item
F: Use item
R: Cheat button (generates 10 arrows and 10 bombs -> gets replaced through
   microtransactions next patch)
Space: Interacting (does nothing at the moment)
