### Game mechanic 1: Dialogue Box ###

The dialogue box consists of two parts:
First the background is generated and
second the actual text.


*** Background ***

Option 1:
is a large sprite, which has the same width as the actual game window and a
certain height. It is located static at the bottom of the Screen and displayed
whenever a dialogue takes place.

Option 2:
The background is a basic shape like a filled rectangle.
It is rendered whenever and wherever it is needed with the Text.
This option requires a dynamic coupled moving of both Background and Text.

Text:
The mechanics for the Text are coupled in a specific Class, which provides
basic text editing functions like changing the text size Font and color and the
text itself.


*** Rendering ***

In order to assure a correct rendering the background has to be rendered before
the Text.
Since the current rendering requires Textures, an additional conversion for the
basic shape and the text is also needed. (e.g. in the resource loader)

Option 1 Background sprite + Text

This approach renders the Background once and hides it whenever it is not
needed. When the dialogue is active, every undesired interaction will hide the
box and exit the dialogue. During the dialogue no update of any other object
takes place only the updates according to the dialogue or text themselves.
(turned off by a flag)

The text is converted and rendered, when it appears or changes. Rendering any
new text destroys the old texture.

Option 2 Background shape + Text

The text and Background is converted and rendered, when it appears, moves or
changes.
Rendering any new text destroys the old texture. Moving the text requires the
same for the background.
